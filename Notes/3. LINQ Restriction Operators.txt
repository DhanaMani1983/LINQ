LINQ samples can be found in the link LINQ 101 samples 

In LINQ restriction functions, we can pass two input parameters, first being the collection element and option second position 
will be the position as below

string[] numbers = {"Zero","One","Two","Three","Four","Five","Six","Seven","Eight","Nine" };
            var shortDigits = numbers.Where((number, index) => number.Length < index);
            Console.WriteLine("Digit's length less than the position");
            foreach(string s in shortDigits)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(s);
            }
