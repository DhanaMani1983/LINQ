LINQ Query Execution
###############################################

In Linq we should be aware of three things which is 
what is query
what is execution
what is result

string numberString = "9742863514";

            var sNumber = numberString
                         .Select(s => int.Parse(s.ToString()))
                         .Where(i=>i%3==0)
                         .ToList();
            foreach(int s in sNumber)
            {                
                Console.WriteLine("Numbers divisibe by 3:{0}", s);
            }   

var sNumber section is the query and the query will get executed when the for each loop runs. The result 
of the query is Ienumerable. 

Query execution of three types

Defered Execution - while writing the query if i dont want to execute it, only when during for each.
Immediate Execution - if you use to list in the query, then it becomes a result and stored in memory
Query Reuse - if there is no tolist or toarray in the query we can reuse it for different purpose.
